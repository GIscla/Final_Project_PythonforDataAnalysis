# Final_Project_PythonfroDataAnalysis

The task that had to be accomplished was to classify all the blocks of the page layout of a document that has been detected by a segmentation process (the RLSA).

My conclusion is that classifying is a sucess, but it would have been better to have less texts in the dataset so we could have more easily read the final confusion matrix.
